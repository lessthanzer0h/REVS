IT MAY HELP YOU AVOID GETTING INFRINGED!! \n\nThe attached list is a useful guide so make good use of it and share the list with everyone you know. The more of you who view the list on a daily basis the more beneficial it will be to everyone. Note the following: \n\n- There are a total of 50 locations listed today with a total of 10 school zones.\n\n- Be on the look out for the early morning and occasional late night double speed camera set up. They set up as early as 4.30am and late nights tend to stay until 12.10am from past experience. These set up locations don\u2019t necessarily align with the attached list so be mindful of that. \n\n- Also look out for possible early set ups on rural roads.\n\n- Be advised that you may still come across speed cameras that aren't on the attached list during the day, particularly on rural roads. The list is a fantastic guide for many speed camera locations but isn't completely exclusive. \n\n- Keep your eyes peeled for any confirmed speed camera sightings, traffic police activity, crashes or other traffic alerts and message them to us directly. We greatly appreciate your reports and rely on YOUR sightings to inform everyone else. \n\n- Having said that, enjoy your day, drive safely and don't get pinged by any speed traps! Let's commence the week without incurring any infringements!\n\n*These locations can be found from the link below: \n\nhttps://www.police.wa.gov.au/Traffic/Cameras/Camera-locations",

IT MAY HELP YOU AVOID GETTING INFRINGED!! \n\nThe attached list is a useful guide so make good use of it and share the list with everyone you know. The more of you who view the list on a daily basis the more beneficial it will be to everyone. Note the following: \n\n- There are a total of 44 locations listed today.\n\n- Be on the look out for occasional late night double speed camera set up. Late nights tend to stay until 12.10am from past experience. These set up locations don\u2019t necessarily align with the attached list so be mindful of that. \n\n- Also look out for possible early set ups on rural roads.\n\n- Be advised that you may still come across speed cameras that aren't on the attached list during the day, particularly on rural roads. The list is a fantastic guide for many speed camera locations but isn't completely exclusive. \n\n- Keep your eyes peeled for any confirmed speed camera sightings, traffic police activity, crashes or other traffic alerts and message them to us directly. We greatly appreciate your reports and rely on YOUR sightings to inform everyone else. \n\n- Having said that, enjoy your day, drive safely and don't get pinged by any speed traps! Let's conclude the weekend without incurring any infringements!\n\n*These locations can be found from the link below: \n\nhttps://www.police.wa.gov.au/Traffic/Cameras/Camera-locations",
